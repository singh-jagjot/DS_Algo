// This one is complicated to understand but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position
// while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its
// rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable.
// We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on cyclic-dependencies between elements.
